# 50-Day Python Mini Projects Challenge

Welcome to the **50-Day Python Mini Projects Challenge**! This repository contains a collection of daily Python mini projects, each designed to help you learn and practice Python and Streamlit. Every day, a new project is added, covering a variety of topics from beginner to advanced.

## How It Works
- Each day features a new Python mini project.
- All projects are implemented as Streamlit web apps for interactive learning.
- Projects are organized in the `projects/` folder, named by day and topic.
- The main dashboard (`app.py`) provides a central place to track progress and launch each app.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) (`pip install streamlit`)

### Running the Challenge Dashboard
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit
   ```
3. Run the main dashboard:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
4. Use the sidebar dropdown to select and launch any day's project.

### Running an Individual Project
You can also run any project directly:
```bash
streamlit run projects/<project_file.py>
```
